COMMENT     WGS REFSEQ: This record is provided to represent a collection of
            whole genome shotgun sequences. The reference sequence was derived
            from AFBM00000000.
            The Bacteroides clarus YIT 12056 whole genome shotgun (WGS) project
            has the project accession NZ_AFBM00000000.  This version of the
            project (01) has the accession number NZ_AFBM01000000, and consists
            of sequences AFBM01000001-AFBM01000034.
            Bacteroides clarus YIT12056 (No 16S rRNA gene available) is a
            member of the Bacteroidetes division of the domain bacteria and has
            been isolated from the gut.
            
            This is a reference genome for the Human Microbiome Project. This
            project is co-owned with the Human Microbiome Project DACC.
            
            Bacteria and source DNA were provided by Masami Morotomi, PhD
            (Yakult Central Institute for Microbiological Research, 1796 Yaho,
            Kunitachi, 186-8650 Tokyo, Japan). Isolation of bacteria and DNA
            preparation were funded by the Yakult Central Institute for
            Microbiological Research.
            
            Coding sequences were predicted using GeneMark v3.3 and Glimmer2
            v2.13. Intergenic regions not spanned by GeneMark and Glimmer2 were
            blasted against NCBI's non-redundant (NR) database and predictions
            generated based on protein alignments. tRNA genes were determined
            using tRNAscan-SE 1.23 and non-coding RNA genes by RNAmmer-1.2 and
            Rfam v8.0. Gene names are generated at the contig level and may not
            necessarily reflect any known order or orientation between contigs.
            
            The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National
            Institutes of Health (NIH) is funding the sequence characterization
            of the Bacteroides clarus YIT 12056 genome.
